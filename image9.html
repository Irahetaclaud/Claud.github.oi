Sivar is a slang word for the capital, San Salvador or the country, El Salvador, and 503 is the area code of the country. The monument in the middle is located in the capital and is called El Salvador del Mundo in which is a famous monument, and the bird behind it is the national bird call El Torogoz. With this festival, I wanted to unite Salvadorians as well as non-Salvadorians to learn and enjoy Salvadorian food, music, dances, and more. For the aesthetics of the theme, I decided to go with neon and bright colors as well as ideas of excitement, family, sweet, and brightness to get people's attention.</p></div>
