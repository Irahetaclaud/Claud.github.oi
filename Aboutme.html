    <div class="col" style="background-color:white;"><h1></h1> <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; "> </p><p class="sansserif" style="text-align: left;"> When listening to stories about how a lot of designers got their toes dipped into the design world, there is this "I started drawing since I was five," no shame in people who have this narrative. I can't relate to this. Yes, I had an interest in art, themes, and crafting since I was young, but I didn't think that it would be my future career. Graphic design came to me as a blur in my junior year of high school, and it felt like destiny put me in this path. In the beginning, I enter graphic design with a blindfold, not knowing or understanding what the major entail, but my instinct told me to work hard, be proactive, and continue. At DeAnza college were I did graphic design classes, I understood and felt like destiny put me in this path. Currently, I am a graphic design student at San Jose State University. My purpose as a designer is for my work to get my audience to react, feel emotion,  get curious about my work. In every project, I strive for uniqueness and that what I want to communicate is delivered, which is an essential value for me. I want people to at least find one exciting thing out of my work, and lastly, I would love to inspire people. Most importantly, I want to impact the world and spread positivity with my designs. But on my technical side, as a person that follows self values and will work hard for success, my goal is to grow in every project I work on and to be broadly diverse on different mediums and design styles.
