	<h1 class="sansserif">What is New Media Art?</h1>

	<p class="sansserif">When thinking about new media art, I thought it had to do with the evolution of technology. I do have to do that but I never consider how humans have considerable involvement with the art piece itself. For example, I saw a performer/artist walk to the stage and had multiple shirts on and start taking them off and talk in a lower exaggerated voice. I couldn’t relate to that type of art and felt a little ostracized, but then I realized that new media art is represented in different mediums and how it evolves with technology and concepts. As a graphic designer I tend to go more phore poster design, branding, animation or anything that looks artistically flashy. And I found three artists that represent new media and get my attention, and thoroughly, I enjoy their work.</p>
	<p class="sansserif">The first artist is called Kenneth Goldsmith, a famous editor, poet, artist, and critic. He collaborated with LABOR and UbuWeb and as well held his poetry installation at the MOMA in 2013. The piece that interested me in him is called 73 Poems, in which he collaborates with an opera singer called Joan La Barbara. This work consists of poems, written with letters or numbers, and creates shapes and patterns. In total, they are 73, so if you click them individually, you can hear Joan La Barbara make experimental sounds pertaining to the poem. I enjoy the interaction by clicking every card and trying to make the essence of the poem. But most of all, as a graphic design student, I appreciate the aesthetic, the minimalist, color , type layout and how interesting it looks at making patterns or shapes with numbers and letters. For my future work, I would like to make something design-wise with an audio connection, and I feel it will give the artwork an interesting turn as well. It will engage the audience with two sensory information rather than one. Mostly I am interested in the shape of these cards because they can make some interesting logos or patterns for different artwork. I love sound, especially asmr, or nature sounds or off voices and that can be involved in my future work as well. It's a project that will get me out of my comfort zone and will make me think ahead of the medium I used to, but I am up for a challenge. Goldsmith represents new media effectively ,he uses different technologies and media to create complex stories in each card.  Here is the link to observe Goldsmiths work: http://www.ubu.com/contemp/goldsmith/goldsmith_la.html my personal favorits is from 41-50.  </p>
	<p class="sansserif">The second artist that interested me is a Belgian born artist called Evelin Brosi. They created a book called 34650 seconds that consist of pages with different phrases and structures differently as well. To make a better sense, the popular word used in the book is iimspipsiss, and the words are rewritten in three columns and not aligned, giving it an optical illusion. The paper on the sides are whole punch giving it texture. As well there is a collection of the cd of a person reading the book and repeating the words. On a design point, it's refreshing to see new ways to use type as the was Brosi did. For more abstract design work, I can draw with text and make different shapes with it. And as with the cd's, I enjoyed the simplicity of the transparent case and letters behind. It shows that design can be simple, clean, and effective and that I can play with different materials and compositions to make it unique and it's something that I would like to experiment with my work. Optical the optical illusion that she makes is so seamless but it's so obvious as well, I strive for that quality of work. As seen, repetition is an element that Brosi uses the most and I can adapt that to different patterns or just a fun typographic poster.  Here is the link to observe Brosi’s work: http://www.ubu.com/contemp/brosi/index.html </p>
	<p class="sansserif">Lastly, Even Though this isn't a poster design, Shin Chien Huang has such a fantastic art installation that excited me. His last installment called Reusable Universe: Shin Chien Huang was one of his biggest shows by far. The facility is in a dark room with the hanging jellyfishes and other sea creatures created with trash such as plastic, tubes, lights, computer parts, bottles, vents, and more. Each piece has a unique color, shape, and lighting patterns, and as one, it makes the audience feel like they are in the bottom of the ocean looking at these animals move and live, but in reality, what you are seeing is trash made into art. Huang's universe inspired me to use more color in my design. I like the contrast of the darkness with neon lights, it gives a peaceful energy as well as movement. Color palettes and the effect of light are pleasant to see, maybe as well I can adapt that to my personal projects. When it comes to my work, Huang's installation will be hard to try to reflect in my work, but what I can use is the idea of recycling, and so some prints in recycled paper or use different materials and scan them. But small details like that can influence my work and concepts. I want to create work that people can interact with to feel emotions. Video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBuK21qDSPQ </p>
